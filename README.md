# Calorie_Calculator

This a basic Calorie Calculator which takes in all the inputs and gives the output based on the input if its **Deficit** or **Surplus**.
This project had given me a good practice of working with Forms and Inputs and Form Validation. Also a bit of regular expressions for matching expressions.
